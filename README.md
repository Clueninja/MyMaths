# MyMaths
A maths module in order to represent polynomials and non continuous functions in an intuitive way

The gui is used as a frontend to plot graphs

1: input a polynomials in the form 2x^2+-2x+5 , 2x^3+2x^-1+5x+-3

2: Set a range for this polynomial eg 0 -> 10

3: Repeat steps 1 to 2 without overlapping the functions or creating a gap eg 0->10, 12-> 20 will error, 0->10 , 10->20 will not

4: Enter range for the functions to be plotted, over long distances this may be slow, I haven't tested this.

5: Use zoom, pan etc to see further information

The modules include examples of code to get started with plotting.
